-- In this project, I am querying a database that holds data for bike lanes in a city. 
-- For the two queries, I demonstarte how to use a Common Table Expression (CTE) and a Window Function to get the results I needed.

-- #1. Your boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. 
-- She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".
with safety_avg as (
select street, avg(safetyrating) as Rating
from CityBikeLanes
group by street)

select street, Rating, 'Safe Lane' as label
from safety_avg
where Rating >= 4
order by Rating desc;

-- #2. A list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, 
-- and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".
select street, safetyrating, avg(safetyrating) over (partition by street) as "Average_Safety_Rating",
    case
        when avg(safetyrating) over (partition by street) >= 4 then 'Leave As-Is'
        when avg(safetyrating) over (partition by street) <= 2.5 then 'Remove'
        else 'Improvements Needed'
    end as "Recommendation"
