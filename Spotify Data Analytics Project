-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data on the top 50 songs in 2021 from Kaggle.
-- I created a table in SQLite Studio to insert the Spotify data into.
-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
-- I explored the data and used SQL to answer some questions I had.
-- At the bottom is also a description of the 14 variables about the songs.

-- Here is the table:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

-- Below are the questions, with the SQL used to get the results I was looking for:

-- #1. Who are all the artists?
select artist_name
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name;

-- #2. Who has the most songs in this top 50 and how many do they have?
select artist_name, count(artist_name) as Total_Songs
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by count(artist_name) desc
limit 2;

-- #3. What are the names of Olivia Rodrigo's and Doja Cat's songs?
select artist_name, track_name
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo' 
or artist_name = 'Doja Cat'
order by artist_name asc;

-- #4. What is the AVG Popularity?
select avg(popularity)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- #5. How many songs have a high, average, below average, and low popularity within this top 50?
select count(*),
    case
        when popularity >= 90 then 'High Popularity'
        when popularity >= 80 then 'Average Popularity'
        when popularity >= 70 then 'Below Average Popularity'
        else 'Poor Popularity'
    end as 'Popularity_Rating'
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by "Popularity_Rating"
order by count(*) desc;

-- #6. Who are the top 10 artists by popularity?
select artist_name, popularity, track_name
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

-- #7. Is there a relationship between popularity and song key? energy? tempo? speechiness? instrumentalness?
select artist_name, track_name, popularity, song_key, energy, tempo, speechiness, instrumentalness
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

-- #8. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs
select avg(danceability) as Avg_Danceability_TOP10
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

-- #9. What artist released the longest song?
select artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by duration_ms desc
limit 1;

-- Description of the data in each column:

-- Popularity - The higher the value the more popular the song is
-- Danceability - The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song
-- Energy - The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energtic. song
-- Key - the key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1 (range: -1; 11)
-- Loudness (dB) - The higher the value, the louder the song
-- Mode - indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0

-- Instrumentalness - the number of vocals in a song. The closer the value to 1.0, the more instrumental the song is
-- Liveness - The higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording
-- Valence - The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song
-- Tempo - the overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM)
-- Duration - duration of the song in ms
