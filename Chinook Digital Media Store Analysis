-- For this project, I am working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables 
-- for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers(as well as a few others). 
-- I am querying some questions that I had about this dataset. Below are the questions and its queries.

-- #1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
select FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
from chinook.customers
where Country <> 'USA';

-- #2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
select *
from chinook.customers
where Country = 'Brazil';

-- #3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
select FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
from chinook.invoices I
join chinook.customers C
on I.CustomerId = C.CustomerId
where Country = 'Brazil';

-- #4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
select *
from chinook.employees
where Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- #5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
select distinct BillingCountry
from chinook.invoices;

-- #6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
select FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId
from chinook.employees E
join chinook.customers C
on E.EmployeeId = C.SupportRepId
join chinook.invoices I
on C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId;

-- #7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
select I.InvoiceId, I.Total, C.FirstName as Cust_FirstName, C.LastName as Cust_LastName, C.Country as Cust_Country, E.FirstName as Rep_FirstName, E.LastName as Rep_LastName
from chinook.employees E
join chinook.customers C
on E.EmployeeId = C.SupportRepId
join chinook.invoices I
on C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId;

-- #8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
select count(*) as Total_Invoices_2009
from chinook.invoices
where InvoiceDate like '2009%';

-- #9 What are the total sales for 2009?
select sum(Total) as Total_Sales_2009
from chinook.invoices
where InvoiceDate like '2009%';

-- #10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
select T.Name as track_name, II.InvoiceLineId as invoice_line_ID
from chinook.tracks T
join chinook.invoice_items II
on T.TrackId = II.TrackId;

-- #11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
select A.Name as artist_name, T.Name as track_name, II.InvoiceLineId as invoice_line_ID
from chinook.tracks T
join chinook.invoice_items II
on T.TrackId = II.TrackId
join chinook.albums AL
on AL.Albumid = T.Albumid
join chinook.artists A
on A.Artistid = AL.Artistid;

-- #12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
select T.Name as 'Track Name', AL.Title as 'Album Name', MT.Name as 'Media Type', G.Name as 'Genre'

join chinook.albums AL
on T.Albumid = AL.Albumid
join chinook.media_types MT
on T.MediaTypeid = MT.MediaTypeid
join chinook.genres G
on T.Genreid = G.Genreid;

-- #13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
select E.FirstName as 'Rep First Name', E.LastName as 'Rep Last Name', Round(sum(I.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
from chinook.employees E
join chinook.customers C
on E.Employeeid = C.SupportRepid
join chinook.invoices I
on C.Customerid = I.Customerid
group by E.FirstName
order by I.Total desc;

-- #14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
select E.FirstName as 'Rep First Name', E.LastName as 'Rep Last Name', Round(sum(I.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'

where E.FirstName = 'Steve' and E.LastName = 'Johnson'
order by C.FirstName asc;

-- #16. Who are the top 5 artists with the most albums?
select A.Name, count(AL.title) as 'Number of Albums'
from chinook.artists A
join chinook.albums AL
on A.Artistid = AL.Artistid
group by A.Name
order by count(AL.title) desc
limit 5;
